<h3 align="center"><u>Exploring the sustainability in asphalt life cycle</u></h3>
</br>
<p>While often overlooked when discussing construction materials, asphalt is one of the fundamental and most widely used materials in construction industry today and will most likely remain so, at least until flying cars become the norm (even then there will still be cyclists).</p>
</br>
<p>With that in mind, it is important to explore the effect of this material on the world we live in, and how current practices within the industry will impact the future generations.</p>
<p>In this short brief we will try to do so following the life cycle of the material.</p>
</br>
<p>The life cycle of asphalt was examined through following sections:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Uses for asphalt as a raw material</li>
  <li>Technologies used in asphalt production</li>
  <li>Waste and pollution associated with asphalt</li>
  <li>Asphalt recycling</li>
  <li>Developing technologies</li>
</ul>
</br>
<p>The scope of this project is best depicted on a roadmap that serves as a graphic guide.</p>
</br>
</br>
<img src="roadmap.jpg" alt="Roadmap" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
</br>
</br>
<p>Before getting into specifics, it might be a good idea to examine what actually constitutes asphalt as a material.</p>
</br>
<img src="asphalt.jpg" alt="Asphalt">
</br>
</br>
<p>Asphalt is a mixture of aggregates, binder and filler.</br>Different mixes of these components are used depending on the Asphalt required for each job.</br>In order to bind the aggregates together into a cohesive mixture a binder is required, most commonly Bitumen is used for this purpose, although a series of bio-based binders are also under development with the aim of minimising the environmental impact.</p>
<p>You may still hear people referring to Tarmac and tarring a road. In Ireland tar has not been used in road construction since the 1990’s. Tar is totally different from bitumen. They are both black, but tar comes from coal and bitumen from heavy crude oil.</p>
<p>There are many different Types of Asphalt, some of the more used mixes in construction are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>HRA – Hot Rolled Asphalt is a predominantly a sand based mix. In approximately 30 to 35 percent of its uses, pre-coated chippings are applied to its surface onsite by a chipping machine (chipper) and rolled into the hot mix. This provides surface texture for zones where vehicles will be breaking, for example at roundabouts. </li>
  <li>SMA - Stone Mastic Asphalt is mainly used in road construction as it has high strength, durability and is resistant to deformations</li>
  <li>WMA - Warm Mix Asphalt is a bituminous mixture that embracing technology that allows the material to be manufactured at lower production temperatures. This reduces the amount of fuel required to dry and heat the aggregates in the bituminous material, resulting in lower energy consumption and lower CO2 emissions. Incorporating this technology means that the performance characteristics of the Warm Mix Asphalt are the equivalent of a HRA despite being produced at a lower temperature. Warm Mix Asphalt is a “greener” more environmentally sustainable option.</li>
</ul>
<p>Europe has over 2500 asphalt production sites and over 9500 companies are involved in asphalt production and/or laying.</p>

    <li>85% of asphalt used in the world is used for road construction</li>
    <li>Asphalt concrete commonly known as macadam is a dense, medium or open graded blend of mineral aggregate, cushed rock and bitumen that complies with EN13108 and the TII specification for road works</li>
    <li>Hot rolled asphalt (HRA) is a dense mixture of mineral aggregate, sand, filler and bitumen that complies with EN13108 and the TII specification for road works</li>

Recycled asphalt pavement (RAP) content in new asphalt production varies greatly between plants, with the more basic plants expected to utilise as little as 15% RAP and the larger, more technologically advanced plants with the capacity to use 100% RAP.</p>

	<h3 align="center"><u>Waste and pollution associated with asphalt</u></h3>
</br>
<img src="smoke.jpeg" alt="Emmisions" style="float: right; margin: 20px;" width="180px" height="auto"> 
  <p>As a petroleum based product asphalt is a highly volatile organic compound substance and during its production, just like during any other crude oil refinement process, certain amount of harmful gasses are released. The exact amount of those emissions vary from source to source but among most commonly mentioned are carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, sulfur and benzene.</p>
  <p>By using modern technology most of those emissions can be more or less effectively contained, and of course that aspect of industry is being continuously improved.</p>
  <p>According to study conducted at Yale University in 2020, asphalt emissions increase significantly when subjected to temperatures above 40 degrees celsius. which is actually a normal temperature for asphalt roads during summer months in southern europe, southern United States and similar climates. So according to that study even when just sitting in the sun asphalt is actually a pollutant.</p>
  <p>Full article on that can be found <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2253470-asphalt-on-roads-may-soon-be-greater-source-of-air-pollution-than-cars/" target="_blank">here</a></p>

</br>
  <img src="waste.jpeg" alt="Waste" style="float: right; margin: 20px;" width="180px" height="auto">
  <p>The best practice in pavement industry lies in recyling.</p>
  <p>In total about 100 million metric tonnes of bitumen is used every year worldwide, about 85% of that is used for paving, 10% for roofing and 5% on other uses.</p>
  <p>With that figures in mind its interesting to see the Irish Environmental Protection Agency report for 2018 where bituminous mixes account for only 1% of out of Ireland 6.2 million tonnes of construction and demolition waste</p>

  <p><u>Asphalt roof shingles</u></p>
  <p>In the U.S. approximately 13 million tons of aspahlt roof shingles are removed from old roofs each year, at current recycling rates only about 10% of that figure gets recycled each year into paving and roads.</p>
  <p>New technologies are developing this year that is projected to see upwards of 90% of old asphalt roof shingles being recycled and reused back into brand new shingles.</p>
  <p>These new technologies are also being explored through a developing grinding process to be used on all asphalt products with the goal of creating a circular economy for asphalt in general.</p>
  <p>GAF is committing more than $100 million in research and to bring this process to a commercial scale</p>
